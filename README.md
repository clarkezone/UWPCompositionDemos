# UWPCompositionDemos

I work on the Composition team at Microsoft that builds the Windows.UI.Composition APIs for the Universal Windows Platform.

This project is where I'll be putting demos of the API's functionality when I get time :-)

Our official team sample repo is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/composition

This currently compiles and runs on the latest Windows Insider preview build of the OS with UWP SDK 10563
