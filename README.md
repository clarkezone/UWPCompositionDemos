# UWPCompositionDemos

I work on the Composition team at Microsoft that builds the Windows.UI.Composition APIs for the Universal Windows Platform.

This project is where I'll be putting demos of the API's functionality when I get time :-)

Our official team sample repo is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCompositionSamples

Recently added some examples of Vector Graphics which you can read about in [this blogpost](https://clarkezone.github.io/blogging/wuc/2019/05/05/animated-vector-graphics-using-windows_ui_composition.html)

There are also some more C++ demos in my fork of Kenny's cppwinrt demo project here: https://github.com/clarkezone/cppwinrt
